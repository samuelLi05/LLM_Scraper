### Additional Tips:
- **Material Compatibility**: Ensure the screws are compatible with the model's material (wood, plastic, metal) to prevent stripping and ensure a secure fit.
- **Cost Considerations**: Compare pricing across suppliers, considering bulk options from McMaster-Carr for quantity needs.

By focusing on these suppliers and considerations, you can achieve precise and reliable fasteners essential for your scale replica project.
